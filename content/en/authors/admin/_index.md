**I'm Minseok Kwon, majoring in Computer Science with a focus on frontend development.
After building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I gained practical experience through React and TypeScript-based projects.
With a strong understanding of component-based architecture, I have developed with reusability and maintainability in mind.
I also have experience effectively managing complex data flows using state management libraries such as Redux and Recoil.
I enjoy quickly learning and applying new technologies, and I aim to become a developer who contributes to team performance and growth.**
