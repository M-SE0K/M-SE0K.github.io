# Soundtrack #1

## ðŸ’­ Why I Love This Movie

A sweet romance that depicts Park Hyung-sik and Han So-hee's journey from 20 years of friendship to love, accompanied by music. As a Disney+ original, the clean and sophisticated direction stands out.

As a music-centered drama, the OST is truly beautiful. Especially K.Will's "Loving You" perfectly captures the drama's sentiment. The scenes of conveying emotions through music are romantic and touching.

The progression from friends to lovers is natural and heart-fluttering. At just 4 episodes, it's perfect for binge-watching in one sitting, and the clean ending is satisfying. It's the perfect work when you need a sweet romance.
