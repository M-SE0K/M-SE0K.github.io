## ðŸ’­ Why I Love This Song

Lee Mujin's emotional vocals and heartfelt lyrics truly resonate with me. The high notes in the chorus are particularly impressive, and listening to this song gives me a profound sense of comfort and healing.

This track becomes even more meaningful when I'm going through difficult times or feeling exhausted. Every single lyric is relatable, and Lee Mujin's delicate emotional expression is outstanding. The title "Assignment Song" metaphorically captures how we live like we're completing assigned tasks, which adds depth to its message.

It's especially moving when listened to during late-night hours or in solitude, allowing me to fully appreciate the emotional depth. The beautiful melody line combined with the simple yet sophisticated arrangement makes it a song I never tire of, no matter how many times I listen to it.
