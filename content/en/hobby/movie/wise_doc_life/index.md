# Hospital Playlist

## 💭 Why I Love This Movie

The perfect combination of director Shin Won-ho and writer Lee Woo-jung has created the ultimate healing drama. The friendship and daily lives of the Class of '99 (five medical school classmates) are portrayed with warmth and realism.

What makes this drama special is its portrayal of human doctors. Their sincerity in treating patients, friendship with colleagues, love for family, and each person's struggles and growth are all expressed without exaggeration, making it even more moving.

The Class of '99 band's music is also a major charm of the drama. The scenes of them performing are healing just to watch, and each song connects to the story, making it more meaningful. Especially "Someone Like You" is a masterpiece.

When I'm tired and feeling down, watching this drama makes me think 'I should live my life with good people too'. It's a drama that reminds us of the preciousness of life and the value of relationships.
