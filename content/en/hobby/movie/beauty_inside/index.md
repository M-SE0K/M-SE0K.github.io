# Beauty Inside

## 💭 Why I Love This Movie

A story about a man who transforms into a different form every day and the woman who loves him. This unique romantic film tells a story about true inner beauty rather than external appearance.

Han Hyo-joo's performance truly shines. Her portrayal of loving a partner who changes into a different person every day feels genuine, and the emotional transitions are delicately expressed. Having multiple actors play one character was also a fresh approach.

The message that "love is not what you see but what you feel" resonates deeply. In a modern society that tends to focus on appearance and external beauty, this film makes you reconsider what true love and inner beauty really mean.
