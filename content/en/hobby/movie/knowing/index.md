# Nevertheless

## ðŸ’­ Why I Love This Movie

The chemistry between Song Kang and Han So-hee is truly perfect. The story beautifully depicts two people carrying their own wounds and pain, healing each other.

The storytelling inspired by the butterfly effect is impressive. The realistic emotional line of "knowing but unable to help it" resonates deeply, and the honest portrayal of imperfect people feels more genuine.

The OST is also excellent. Especially "Butterfly" perfectly captures the drama's sentiment. It's a work that conveys the story of youth's pain, love, and growth through sophisticated visuals.
