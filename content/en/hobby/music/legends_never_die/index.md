## ðŸ’­ Why I Love This Song

The 2017 Worlds anthem that reminds me of Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok), the greatest player in esports history. The lyrics "Legends Never Die" perfectly encapsulate Faker's entire career and legacy.

Since his debut in 2013, Faker has maintained top-tier performance for over a decade, setting countless records. With three World Championship victories (2013, 2015, 2016) and a fourth in 2023, he proved himself as a true legend. When this song plays during highlights of his plays, it creates a perfect, goosebump-inducing moment.

What Faker has shown us transcends mere gaming skill. His unwavering determination in the face of adversity, sacrifice for the team, relentless self-improvement, and humilityâ€”all of these align perfectly with the message of "Legends Never Die." I'll never forget how he rose back to the top in 2017 when retirement rumors were circulating due to emerging young talents.

Every time I listen to this song, I'm inspired to give my best like Faker and gain courage to overcome any difficulty. When I hit a wall in development or feel like giving up, I remember this song along with Faker's famous quote: "Effort never betrays you." This is my life's anthem, filled with respect and gratitude for a true legend.
